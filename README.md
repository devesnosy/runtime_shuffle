# runtime_shuffle

A drop in replacement for Zig builtin shuffle but with runtime mask support

If you find my work useful please consider donating via PayPal.me, I'm going through very difficult times right now,
jobless and forced to pay an amount of money every month, I'm sadly unable to do it, every little help when all combined hopefully will help me out of this, you can also pay me to do a piece of Zig, Python, C or C++ code for you, thank you.
